Ruby-Gnome CheckBoxes

Create a simple shopping list.
Maintain a check list of reacuring chores.
Anything that one would make a check list for.

Just a really simple app for now.
The next step would be to allow for multiple lists.
As is now, just maintains a sigle list, a single data file.

To add a column press the '+' button on the left.
To add an item to a column press the '+' button above it.
The application automatically deletes empty cells on restart, and
you can restart by closing the application andthen pressing
the docked icon to re-open.
